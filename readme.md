    Artificium Clone

    ![Artificium Clone Preview](preview.png)

    A modern, responsive collaborative workspace application built with the MERN stack.

    Welcome to the Artificium Clone repository! This project is a clone of a collaborative workspace platform, featuring user authentication, workspace management, and a sleek dark-themed UI powered by Tailwind CSS. Deployed on Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend), it integrates AWS S3 for storage, Firebase for authentication, and MongoDB for data management.

    Explore the frontend to experience the login, registration, and workspace features in action!

    Backend URL
    The backend is hosted on Render. You can activate it if inactive by sending a request to:

    [(https://artificium-clone.onrender.com)]

    (Note: The free tier on Render may spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity. A simple GET request to the root URL or any endpoint will wake it up. Check the Render dashboard logs for status.)

    About the Project
    This project is a personal endeavor to replicate the core functionalities of a collaborative workspace tool like Artificium. Built over weeks with dedication, it showcases a responsive design, secure authentication, and seamless integration of modern web technologies. The goal was to create a functional prototype that can be extended for real-world use.

    Features
    User Authentication: Register, login, and Google OAuth integration using Firebase.
    Workspace Management: Create or join workspaces with dynamic URL generation.
    Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI with Tailwind CSS, optimized for desktops and mobiles.
    Dark Theme: Sleek, modern dark-themed interface with gradient accents.
    API Integration: RESTful backend with MongoDB data storage and AWS S3 for potential file uploads.
    Tech Stack
    Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (v4)
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js
    Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas)
    Authentication: Google Firebase
    Storage: AWS S3
    Hosting: Netlify (Frontend), Render (Backend)

    To run this project locally, follow these steps:


    Copy
    git clone https://github.com/ASHiSHxNagar/Artificium.git
    cd artificium-clone
    Backend Setup
    Navigate to the backend folder:

    cd backend
    Install dependencies:

    npm install
    Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following:
    text

    PORT=3000

    MONGO_URI=your_MONGO_URI
    JWT_SECRET = your_JWT_SECRET
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=''

    TYPE=""
    PROJECT_ID: ""
    PRIVATE_KEY_ID: ""
    PRIVATE_KEY: ""
    CLIENT_EMAIL: ""
    CLIENT_ID: ""
    AUTH_URI: ""
    TOKEN_URI: ""
    AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL: ""
    CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL: ""
    UNIVERSE_DOMAIN: ""

    #This supresesses the aws JS v2 warning

    # AWS_SDK_JS_SUPPRESS_MAINTENANCE_NODE_MESSAGE='1'

    (Get Firebase credentials from Firebase Console > Create New Project > Project Settings > Service Accounts.)
    Start the backend:
    bash

    npm start
    Frontend Setup
    Navigate to the fe folder:

    cd ../frontend
    Install dependencies:

    npm install
    Create a .env file in the frontend  folder and add:

    # chnage its url value with your backend url

    VITE_SERVER_DOMAIN= http://localhost:3000

    # get this from firebase project

    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= ""
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=""
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-"

    Start the frontend:
    npm start

    Run the App
    Ensure both backend and frontend are running. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
    Usage
    Register a new account or log in with Google.
    Create a workspace or join an existing one by entering a unique name.
    Explore the responsive design across different devices.
    Deployment
    This project is deployed for free using:

    Frontend: Netlify (http://artificium-clone.netlify.app)
    Connect your GitHub repository, set build command to npm run build, and publish directory to build.
    Add REACT_APP_API_URL as an environment variable with your Render backend URL.
    Backend: Render (https://artificium-clone.onrender.com)
    Set the root directory to backend in Renderâ€™s dashboard.
    Add environment variables (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS) in Renderâ€™s environment settings.
    Deploy and monitor logs for any issues.
    Note: Renderâ€™s free tier spins down after inactivity. Use a cron job (e.g., cron-job.org) to ping the backend URL every 10 minutes to keep it alive.
